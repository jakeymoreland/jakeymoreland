Hi there, 
My names **Jake Moreland**,

I am a *full stack* dev but I spend 90% of my time on the front-end, building all kinds of apps / projects for both clients and myself using the latest and greatest in whatever's the hot subject!


Also working on some very interesting projects, which will come to light by ~Aug 2022, "SaaS / Another 2 apps and my very own showcase/studio website"
https://initialstudios.com.au keep your eyes peeled.

Loving **Remix**, **React-native**, **tailwind** and anything **AWS**.
